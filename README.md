# Equity - Your Personal Finance Manager

> Completed according to the requirements of the 2022W-T2 CPSC210 Term Project.

## What will the application do?
The application *Equity* will be a personal finance manager
created to help people budget, track income and spending,
and notify users on specific spending habits. The unique feature
about the application *Equity* is it will use a special
algorithm to detect poor spending habits or areas where the user
can save money.

## Who will use it?
Before people even become of age they have access to their own private finances;
whether that is a piggy bank or a dozen different bank cards. *Equity's* target
audience is people with poor spending habits. *Equity* will help users
manage their finances, find ways for them to save money, and help them
break poor spending habits.

## Why is this project of interest to me?
This project is of interest to me because there are too many
solutions out on the internet, and it's difficult to actually
pick one I like. I believe many others also have this problem
so, I thought to myself, like a true software engineer, why
don't I write my own program to solve this problem? I also
think writing an algorithm to detect potentially bad spending
habits is also very interesting which is why I want it to be
the unique features for my application.
